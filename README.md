I have decided to change my career path and learn about computer programming and web developing. It has not been easy to learn at a speedy rate given the time I willingly give to my beautiful family. However, I have made a lot of progress, considering the vast amounts of information available to download into my noggin. Certaintly, knowledge has been attained and so far, this is more fun than I tought it would be.
